# Shadowrun 6E Integration Notes

## Character Creation & Scene Generation Integration

This document outlines how the character creation components and dynamic scene image generation systems can work together cohesively within the Shadowrun multiplayer engine.

### Key Integration Points

#### 1. Character → Scene Image Connection
- Character descriptive elements (appearance, gear, essence anchor) from the Identity step will be used as inputs for scene image generation
- Core Traumas and Core Strengths can influence visual scene elements and mood/tone
- Character's current gear and modifications will be reflected in generated images

#### 2. Technical Data Flow
```
Character Creation → Character Database → Prompt Assembly Engine → AI Image Generation API → Frontend Display
```

#### 3. Development Dependencies
- Phase 1 of Dynamic Scene Image Generation requires Character schema extensions
- Character creation UI components should collect the detailed descriptions needed for quality image generation
- Both systems will leverage the same symbolic role tagging system

#### 4. Integration Timeline
- Complete core character creation components first (Weeks 1-3)
- Begin backend schema extensions for scene generation (Week 4)
- Parallel development of remaining character steps and prompt assembly (Weeks 4-6)
- Frontend integration of both systems (Weeks 7-10)

### Shared Technical Components

#### Database Schema Enhancements
- Character model will need additional descriptive fields
- Scene model will reference character IDs for proper visualization

#### API Endpoints
- `/api/character/:id` will be enhanced to return visual descriptors
- `/api/scene-image-generate` will consume character data

#### User Experience Flow
1. Create character with detailed descriptions and visual elements
2. GM creates scene and assigns characters
3. System generates appropriate scene images based on narrative context and present characters
4. During gameplay, images update to reflect changes in character state or scene conditions

### Next Steps
1. Finalize Character component data structures to ensure they collect all needed descriptive elements
2. Establish consistent tagging system for symbolic roles and visual elements across both systems
3. Create shared environment/mood vocabulary for character traumas/strengths and scene descriptions
