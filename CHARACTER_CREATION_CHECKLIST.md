## ðŸš€ Dynamic Scene Image Generation
*Estimated Timeline: 6-10 Weeks*

### Phase 1: Backend Data Structure & API Preparation *(1 Week, Moderate)*
- [ ] Extend NPC and character database schemas
  - [ ] Add detailed physical descriptions fields
  - [ ] Add clothing/gear descriptions
  - [ ] Implement symbolic role tags
- [ ] Extend Scene database schema
  - [ ] Add detailed location/environmental descriptions
  - [ ] Implement mood/ambiance tags
- [ ] Update Flask REST API with descriptive data endpoints

### Phase 2: Prompt Assembly Engine *(1-2 Weeks, Moderate)*
- [ ] Develop backend functionality to assemble descriptive prompts
- [ ] Implement prompt quality validation system
- [ ] Create logging for prompt history and analytics

### Phase 3: AI Image Generation Integration *(1-2 Weeks, High)*
- [ ] Select and integrate image-generation API (DALLÂ·E, Stable Diffusion, etc.)
- [ ] Configure API keys and ensure usage compliance
- [ ] Build Flask endpoint for image generation (/api/scene-image-generate)
- [ ] Implement error handling, rate-limiting, and caching

### Phase 4: Frontend React Implementation *(1-2 Weeks, Moderate)*
- [ ] Create dedicated React component for scene images
- [ ] Integrate with backend API for image requests
- [ ] Implement user interactions:
  - [ ] Hover-to-view descriptions
  - [ ] Click-to-expand full-screen view
  - [ ] Quick-download buttons

- [ ] Configure backend caching (Redis/CDN)
- [ ] Add image optimization for performance

### Phase 6: Testing & User Feedback *(1-2 Weeks, Iterative)*
- [ ] Conduct internal testing (backend, prompts, frontend, image quality)
- [ ] Collect and analyze user feedback
- [ ] Perform iterative refinements

### Future Enhancements
